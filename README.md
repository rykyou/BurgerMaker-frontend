# Burger Maker

A peer-collaborated, single-page application that mimics interactive menus by allowing users to browse and create personalized burgers. The frontend was built with JavaScript and stylized with Bootstrap as well as custom CSS. The backend API was built using Ruby on Rails, with data persisting to a PostgreSQL database.
